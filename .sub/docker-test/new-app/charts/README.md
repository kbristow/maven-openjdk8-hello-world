# Subatomic Application Helm Chart

## Concepts
This Helm chart is used to deploy Subatomic applications into your Kubernetes clusters.
This default Helm chart is designed to allow a deployment of an application to multiple clusters 
in active/active and creates the following resources:
 - Deployment
 - Service
 - Ingress (optional)

This chart is configured through the various `values.yaml` files in this folder. There are two
types of `values.yaml` files by default:

 - One `values.yaml`
 - Multiple `values-xxx.yaml` (environment values files)
 
The `values.yaml` has all the default values that will be applied to all deployments in all
environments, whilst the `values-xxx.yaml` file contains values only applied to to the 
environment `xxx`. The `values-xxx.yaml` values apply to each cluster where the environment 
`xxx` exists (e.g. sdc dev and 270 dev). Additionally any value appearing in `values-xxx.yaml`
 and `values.yaml` will have the value in `values-xxx.yaml` preferred. For example:
 
`values.yaml`
```yaml
replicas: 1
buildID: 75
```

`values-dev.yaml`
```yaml
replicas: 2
```

The above configuration will result in the merged values below when doing a dev deployment
```yaml
replicas: 2
buildID: 75
```

**Note:** Deep merges do not happen on values - Root values are merged and overlaid only.
Example:

`values.yaml`
```yaml
a:
 b: 1
```

`values-dev.yaml`
```yaml
a:
 c: 2
```

Will become 
```yaml
a:
 c: 2
```

See the full [configuration](#configuration) glossary for details on all values that can be set.

## Common Tasks
This section describes instructions on how to perform a few common tasks when working with this 
Helm Chart.

### Environment Variables
Adding environment variables to an application can be done by adding a section like the following to the
appropriate `values` file:

```yaml
env:
  VAR_1: "Value1"
  VAR_2: "Value2"
```

### Volumes and Mounts
Adding volumes and volumeMounts to an application can be done by adding a section like the following to the
appropriate `values` file:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: secret-mount
    secret:
      secretName: kube-secret-name
  - name: config-mount
    configMap:
      name: kube-config-map-name
      
volumeMounts:
  - name: secret-mount
    mountPath: /path/to/secret/mount/folder/
    
  - name: config-mount
    mountPath: /path/to/config/mount/folder/
```

The above mounts the keys of the secret `kube-secret-name` at the location `/path/to/secret/mount/folder/` with
each key as a file at the target location. Additionally the the keys of the secret `kube-config-map-name` at the 
location `/path/to/config/mount/folder/` with each key as a file at the target location.

### Adding a GSLB ingress
Adding a gslb ingress creates a url that load balances traffic between identical environments in both your target 
clusters (e.g dev in sdc and dev in 270). Example:

Assume you have the following autogenerated ingress's for you application
- Ingress for 270: `my-app-dev.my-cluster.270-nonprod.caas.absa.co.za`
- Ingress for sdc: `my-app-dev.my-cluster.sdc-nonprod.caas.absa.co.za`

To add a gslb ingress for the dev instance of you application add the following to the `values-dev.yaml` file:
```yaml
ingress:
  gslb: "my-app-dev.my-cluster.nonprod.caas.absa.co.za"
```
Notice that the ingress is the same as the those for sdc and 270, minus the `270-` and `sdc-` parts of the ingress
definition. After committing and redeploying your application would be accessible via the load balanced ingress defined
above.

### Adding TLS to ingress's
TLS can be set for all ingress's using the following setting
```yaml
ingress:
  tls: true
```
This applies to fqdn and gslb ingress urls.

### Adding Vanity ingress's
Upon securing a vanity URL from the DNS team (speak to the BKS for guidance) you can use these URL's to front your
application. This can be done using the following option
```yaml
vanityIngress:
  host: my-app.custom-domain.absa.co.za
  tls: true
  clusterIssuer: name-of-cluster-cert-issuer
```

### Config Server Settings
Java applications typically use Config Servers in our environments to pull their configuration in. This can be 
configured using the values files, and is typically done automatically for you by Subatomic. The following is an
example config server configuration in the `values-dev.yaml`:

```yaml
configServer:
  configLabel: master
  profilesActive: "dev,it"
  configUri: "http://subatomic-config-server.team-a-project-a-shared.svc"
```

This configuration says:
 - use the `master` branch to pull the config for the dev environment
 - set the `dev` and `it` Spring profiles as active
 - find the config server endpoint at `http://subatomic-config-server.team-a-project-a-shared.svc`

## Configuration
